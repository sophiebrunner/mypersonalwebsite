          <h3>Past</h3>
          <p>
            Before that, I worked in various roles as a
            <strong>project manager</strong> and <strong>educator</strong>.
            During and after my studies in <strong>cultural studies</strong>,
            <strong>musicology</strong>, and <strong>education</strong>, I
            organized music education projects for the
            <strong>NDR Radiophilharmonie</strong> and the
            <strong>Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra</strong>, and later taught
            at a general education school.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even back then, my work centered around
            <strong>structuring information</strong>, understanding
            <strong>different perspectives</strong>, and
            <strong>communicating clearly</strong> ‚Äî skills that continue to
            shape my approach to development today.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interest in digital media had always been present. I studied
            media as a minor subject and managed the NDR Radiophilharmonie's
            website as a student assistant. Over time, this interest evolved
            into a new professional path.

        <h2>My approach to web development</h2>
        <p>
          I learned web development from teachers who emphasized the
          <strong>fundamentals</strong>: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was only
          introduced to frameworks once I understood how things work under the
          hood.
        </p>
        <p>
          One sentence that stuck with me is:
          <q>You don't need a drill to hammer a nail into the wall.</q>
          <strong>Tools</strong> and <strong>frameworks</strong> can be
          incredibly useful, but they must provide real value. For this website,
          I built on the basics ‚Äî plain and simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          When collaborating with <strong>designers</strong>, I deeply respect
          their work and strive to translate it as faithfully as possible into
          the digital space. However, I also recognize that the web is
          inherently unpredictable, and as a front-end developer, I can only
          make suggestions about how the browser will interpret my code. I draw
          a lot of inspiration from the insights of

          topic.
