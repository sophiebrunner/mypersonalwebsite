          <p>
            I'm currently working as a web developer at
            <a href="https://tollwerk.de">tollwerk GmbH</a> — one of Germany's
            leading agencies for accessible communication. In my role, I focus
            on developing <strong>modern, inclusive websites</strong>, ensuring
            they meet high standards in <strong>accessibility</strong>,
            <strong>usability</strong> and <strong>performance</strong>.

          <h3>Past</h3>
          <p>
            Before that, I worked in various roles as a
            <strong>project manager</strong> and <strong>educator</strong>.
            During and after my studies in <strong>cultural studies</strong>,
            <strong>musicology</strong>, and <strong>education</strong>, I
            organized music education projects for the
            <strong>NDR Radiophilharmonie</strong> and the
            <strong>Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra</strong>, and later taught
            at a general education school.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even back then, my work centered around
            <strong>structuring information</strong>, understanding
            <strong>different perspectives</strong>, and
            <strong>communicating clearly</strong> — skills that continue to
            shape my approach to development today.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interest in digital media had always been present. I studied
            media as a minor subject and managed the NDR Radiophilharmonie's
            website as a student assistant. Over time, I evolved this interest
            into a new professional path.

              In this project, the goal was to create an accessible dashboard to
              showcase the client's efforts toward achieving the United Nations'
              17 Sustainable Development Goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the backend team handled data structuring, I focused on
              making the data presentation in the frontend both accessible and
              user-friendly using
              <strog>semantic HTML</strog>.
            </p>
            <p>
              We applied a
              <strong>progressive enhancement approach</strong>, ensuring core
              information remained accessible to all users. Special attention
              was given to animations, where we implemented controls to
              <strong>stop SVG animations</strong> for users who might be
              affected.
            </p>
            <p>
              Complex UI components like cards with flip effects and
              <strong>accessible tooltips and toggle tips</strong> were
              implemented to ensure a seamless user experience.

              For this project, we aimed to develop an accessible language test
              application,
              <strong>building on a previous accessible prototype</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The challenge was to extend the functionality of the JavaScript
              code so that user responses could be automatically extracted from
              the HTML markup and displayed at the end of the test.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the application needed to <strong>function offline</strong>,
              we ensured it could
              <strong>run locally via the file protocol</strong> without
              requiring a backend or database.
            </p>
            <p>
              Results were stored using the browser's native print
              functionality, making the app easy to use without an internet
              connection while maintaining full accessibility.

        <h2>My approach to web development</h2>
        <p>
          I learned web development from teachers who emphasized the
          <strong>fundamentals</strong>: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was only
          introduced to frameworks once I understood how things work under the
          hood.
        </p>
        <p>
          One sentence that stuck with me is:
          <q>You don't need a drill to hammer a nail into the wall.</q>
          <strong>Tools</strong> and <strong>frameworks</strong> can be
          incredibly useful, but they must provide real value. For this website,
          I built on the basics — plain and simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          When collaborating with <strong>designers</strong>, I deeply respect
          their work and strive to translate it as faithfully as possible into
          the digital space. However, I also recognize that the web is
          inherently unpredictable, and as a front-end developer, I can only
          make suggestions about how the browser will interpret my code. I draw
          a lot of inspiration from the insights of
